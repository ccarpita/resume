              <ul>

            <div><h5>2011</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Wrote a light-weight Javascript framework [non-minified source: m1.isnooth.com/js/xd.js] that combined jQuery design elements with the core functionality of MooTools and included a post-loading mechanism for plugin extensions, and an inter-plugin communication API.</li>
                <li>Worked with the CTO on a fundamental design pattern change within the PHP framework that allowed developers to associate multiple views with a model.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div><h5>2010</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Developed a front-end AJAX module that accepts plain text for a cocktail recipe on The Spirit website [http://thespir.it],  submits to a PHP server-side handler that parses each line for units, measure, and ingredient using a term database.</li>
                <li>Consolidated asynchronous requests into a single view-aggregation controller in PHP.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Implemented a food-wine pairing algorithm in perl. A tree of given terms is used to parse keywords from recipe text, and scored/boosted based on importance and proximity.   The recipe is matched to a flavor profile, which is paired editorially to a set of wine categories.</li>
                <li>Developed a site widget for Epicurious.com and MyRecipes.com that takes a previously processed recipe and recommends wines paired to that recipe flavor profile.  The data is pre-loaded as executable Javascript into a Tokyo Tyrant cache.</li>
                <li>Implemented internal link structure changes based on SEO recommendations, including site indices for Google.</li>

                <li>Worked with the front-end PHP MVC framework, custom-built by the CTO, to develop basic site features like wine variety (group) pages. The framework uses a guide to select a controller, which chooses a view, and this view has an associated loader based on naming conventions.</li>
                <li>Developed a perl module to score the similarity between wines based on 10+ attributes</li>
                <li>Re-factored the perl data-import code to use a single type of model object that creates setter functions which filter their inputs through a given list of subroutines. These routines remove common stop-words and extract data, e.g. pulling vintage from a wine name.</li>
